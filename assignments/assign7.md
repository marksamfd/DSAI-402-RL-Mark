# Assignment 7

**The assignment needs to be uploaded to the google classroom**


## Reading 

- Read Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1 from the main book
- Watch this video [Temporal Difference Learning (including Q-Learning) | Reinforcement Learning Part 4, by Mutual Information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJiG3ykOxmY&t=953s)

## Implementation 

Due 12/12. 

**Comparing Monte Carlo and $n$-step Temporal Difference**

The objective of this assignment is to compare both MC and $n$-step TD algorithms to study the effect of $\alpha$ and $n$. 

<!-- In the video “Temporal Difference Learning (including Q-Learning) | Reinforcement Learning Part 4” by Mutual Information, between minutes 3 and 6, there is a very nice animation of the episodes in the lower panel, accumulated rewards in the upper panel, and the evolving value function on the right lower panel. -->
Your task is to replicate figures in Example 6.2 from the main book, Figure 6.2, Figure 7.2 and the figure at the minute 12:44 from the “Temporal Difference Learning (including Q-Learning) | Reinforcement Learning Part 4” video by Mutual Information,. 

Tasks: 
- Generate multiple episodes of state and reward sequences on a dataset of your preferences
- Implement both Monte Carlo and n-step TD algorithms and to update the value function
- Plot the aforementioned figures
- Study the effect of $\alpha$ and $n$ on your dataset
